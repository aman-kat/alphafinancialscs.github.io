    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Business Loan<br>(if you look properly, there are better alternatives)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            A business loan is a kind of financing you can avail to meet the urgent needs of your growing business (you need to buy some machinery, or you're 
            expanding your business). As with all loans, it involves the creation of a debt, which will be repaid with added interest. Factors like your personal credit 
            score, annual revenue and relationship with the lender will also play a role.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            The foremost priority of any entrepreneur is to see his/her business grow, expand and flourish. 
		        To fulfill this desire, business owners opt for business loans and meet their financial requirements. 
		        However, getting instant funds is not always possible, as banks and NBFCs take their time in deciding whether to sanction loan or not.
            <br><br>
            Business loans are usually secured with collateral, means an asset is kept by the lender for the life of the loan. The collateral can be seized 
            and sold to repay the loan if the borrower defaults. Business loans are available through banks, credit unions and online lenders. And in exchange for the money, they'll charge interest on top of the loan amount, 
            in the most basic loan structure, interest is charged as a percentage of the loan's principal.
            Small businesses can apply to banks or other financial institution for commercial loans. Usually, banks do not make loans to start-ups, but they do make loans to ongoing businesses. 
            There are major steps you should follow through the loan application process and it can become very tedious.

          <h4 class="color" id="alter_1">Alternatives to a business loan</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            If you're asking about our opinion whether you should apply for a business loan or not, we'll say don't, 
            there are pretty good alternatives available (and if you're a start-up raising capital for the first time, you should consider these alternatives first)
            and as business loans are very hard to get approved, so we will give advice to go with one of these alternatives or 
            you can just ignore the things written before and apply for business loan the choice is yours.<br><br>
              <b>Personal loan:</b> Some lenders will allow you to use a personal loan for business expenses. 
              This can be ideal for startups and businesses struggling to meet minimum revenue requirements. 
              And if you see it another way, you can use a personal loan anywhere you want and nobody will care.<br><br>
              <b>Business credit card:</b> For small cashflow needs, a business credit card may be a good option. 
              It can help build your business credit score while earning points or cash back for every dollar spent.<br><br>
              <b>Investor financing:</b> Funding from an angel investor can help take your business to new heights. 
              But you’ll have to be willing to give up equity in your company in return.<br><br>
              <b>Crowdfunding:</b> Are you a startup or newer business thinking of expanding? 
              You might want to look into crowdfunding — it’s a great way to judge 
              interest in your area for your product or service and drum up funding.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">So, what's the upshot?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Business loans are really hard to get approve and there's loads of paperwork and stress getting one approved. There are really good alternatives for 
            business loans, which we have already discussed above. So, from our opinion you should go for the alternatives or the choice is yours.
