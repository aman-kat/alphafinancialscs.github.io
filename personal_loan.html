    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Loan<br>(unexpected tasks came up?)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Simply put it this way, it is an unsecured loan taken by individuals from a bank/NBFC to meet their personal finance needs. 
            And as mentioned earlier, it is an unsecured loan type, so these are not backed by any collateral. 
            This type of loan comes really handy when you have unexpected expenses to take care of. 
            Basically, a personal loan is a fixed amount of money borrowed at a fix rate and repaid over a fixed amount of time in form of EMIs and
            there are a lot of factors on which your creditworthiness is decided, some of those factors are your income level, credit and employment history, repayment capacity, etc.
          </p>
        
          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Personal loans are a great way to offset any temporary financial crunch as it allows the users to avail a loan without any pre-conditions on the usage of the 
            loan amount. Unlike a home or a car loan, a personal loan is not secured against any asset. As it is unsecured and the borrower does not put up collateral 
            like gold or property to avail it. The interest rates on personal loans are higher than the other loans. Personal loans are sanctioned on your creditworthiness 
            only, the lender has to see all facts straight, what is your income? you're paying any EMI currently, your repayment history etc. then if the lender finds you 
            eligible, your loan gets approved, then you pay the loan back with interest.
            <br><br>
            When you're approved for a personal loan, you receive a lump sum of cash to spend, you can spend that as your will no restrictions from the lender. You can 
            use a personal loan for anything: debt consolidation, medical expenses, moving costs, home improvement projects, a car or your wedding. Personal loans 
            have a quick approval as compared to other loans. Getting a personal loan requires minimal documentation as it is based on your credit score and income.
            The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be.

          <h4 class="color">How eligiblity increases and decreases</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
          <b>Income of the applicant:</b> Higher income tends to increase the disbursal amount.<br>
          <b>Current EMI's:</b> Higher EMI payouts typically decrease the disbursal amount.<br>
          <b>Number of dependents:</b> Higher number of dependents usually decrease the disbursal amount.<br>
          <b>Credit Score:</b> Low credit score leads to cancellation of your application.<br>
          There may be <b>other factors</b> that impact the disbursal.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color"><sup>1</sup>Charges and Fees</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            <b>Processing Fees:</b> This is a fee to cover the administrative charges related to the disbursement of a personal loan. Processing fees are usually between 1% and 3% of the loan amount sanctioned.<br><br>
            <b>Prepayment/Foreclosure Charges:</b> When an amount in excess of the standard EMI payment is made, it is counted as pre-payment of a loan. In case an outstanding loan is paid off before the end of its tenure, the process is termed as foreclosure or complete pre-payment. 
              In most cases, lenders charge a fee known as foreclosure charge at the time of making this complete prepayment. Typically prepayment/foreclosure charges range from Nil to 5% of the principal amount prepaid plus applicable taxes on top of the loan principal outstanding.<br><br>
            <b>Late Payment Charges:</b> These charges are levied when the borrower is late in making EMI payments. This is typically a fixed charge that borrower will need to pay along with the due amount.<br><br>
            <b>Cheque Bounce Charges:</b> In case an EMI payment is missed as the account linked to the post-dated cheque is low on funds or the account has been closed, a cheque bounce charge will be applicable. This is typically applied as a fixed charge of around Rs. 500.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color"><sup>1</sup>Documentation</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            <b>Identity Proof:</b> PAN Card/ Voter’s ID/ Aadhaar Card/ Passport/ Driving License<br><br>
            <b>Address Proof:</b> Bank Account Statement/ Aadhaar Card/ Lease/ Property purchase Agreement/ Utility Bills (not more than 3 months old)/ Passport/ Driving License<br><br>
            <b>Income Proof (for Salaried):</b> Salary Slips, Bank Account Statement & Form 16<br><br>
            <b>Income Proof (for Self-employed):</b> Previous Year ITR/ P&L Statement and Balance Sheet/ Bank Account Statement<br><br>
            <b>Business Proof:</b> Certificate of Practice/ Partnership Deed/ GST Registration and Filing Documents/ MOA & AOA/ Shop Act License
          </p>   
          
          <h4 class="color">Consider these before applying</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            <b>Interest Rates:</b> Since personal loans are unsecured in nature, interest rates could be on the higher side. You need to choose from a fixed or a variable interest rate depending on bank or NBFC.<br><br>
            <b>Penalty Charges:</b> Banks & NBFCs charge a high penalty on your loan if in case you don’t pay your dues/EMIs on time.<br><br>
            <b>Analyse loan necessity:</b> Personal loans or any loan are meant for genuine and immediate needs. So, if your financial situation can be handled without taking the loan, you should restrain from taking it.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">So, what's the upshot?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Personal loans is a good idea for consumers with excellent credit score. But if you don't have excellent credit, a personal loan might come with an 
            interest rate, so high that it's more than some credit card rates. So make sure you know the interest rate before you take disbursal of a personal loan.
