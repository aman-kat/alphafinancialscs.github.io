  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Insurance<br>(things you need to know)</h2>
    <div>
      <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
      <p class="bot_padding">An insurance is a contract (policy) between an individual and the insurance company (insurer), where an insurer indemnifies another against losses from specific 
        contingencies and/or perils. Basically Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss, it is a form of risk management. 
        The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium (often paid every month).
        The most common types of personal insuracne policies are auto, health, homeowners and life. And car insurance is requried by law.
        An authority/entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company or insurance carrier. 
        A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder.
      </p>
      
      <h6><b>How Insurance works?</b></h6>
      <p>
        The insured receives a insurance policy or contract, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. 
        If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for compensation.
        <br><br>
        If you're trying to buy a insurace for your business, then keep in mind businesses demand special kind of insurance policies that insure against specific types 
        of risks. For example, an auto dealer require coverage for damage or injury that could occur during test drives or in a machine factory require insurance if in  
        any case machine causes fatal injury to any worker etc. There are also very specific insurance policies available, such as kidnap and ransom (K&R), medical 
        malpractice, and professional liability insurance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6><b>How Insurance companies work?</b></h6>
      <p class="bot_padding">
          The insurance companies work by collecting small amounts of money from its clients and funds that money together to pay for damages, simple.
          Basically they do three things with the premium. First, they pool the money to pay claims. Second, insurance companies pay for expenses involed 
          in selling and providing insurance protection. Earnings from investments help keep down the cost of insurance to policyholders.

    <h4 class="color">if you're looking for the best policy for you or your family</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      ...pay special attention to these three curcial points in insurance company policies
      <br><br>
      <b>The Premium:</b> A premium is policy's price, typically payed per month or once in Six months or Once in a year it depends on your insurer. 
      Premium is determined based on your or your business's risk profile.
      for example, if you're buying a health insurance and you already have some health issues than you're likely to pay more than a person who is in perfect 
      health and don't have any health issues in past. So, the correct policy that is perfect for you might need some legwork, but don't worry about that we're here to 
      help you, let us know what kind of insurance you're looking for you, we'll sort out the things for you.
      <br><br>
      <b>Policy limit:</b> Policy limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay for a coverd loss. Maximum could be payed annual, per loss or injury, or over the life 
      of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum. Higher policy limits carry higher premiums.
      <br><br>
      <b>The Deductible:</b> Deductible is a specific amount the policyholder have to pay from his/her own pocket before insurer pays the claim. 
      The amount policyholder pays serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims. If you're a person who have chronic health issues or need regular 
      medical attention should look for policies with lower deductibles. Though the annual premium is higher than a comparable policy with a higher deductible, 
      less expenses access to medical care thoughout the year may be worth the trade-off.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Benefits</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      - The obvious and most important benefits of insurance is the payment of losses. An insurance policy is a contract used to indemnify individuals
      and organizations for covered losses.<br>
      - Another benefit of insurance is managing cash flow uncertainity. Insurance provides payment for covered losses when they occur.<br>
      - Here's another important one, insurance promotes risk control activity as insurance policies provide incentives to implement a loss control program
      because of policy requirements.<br>
      - Another Insurance benefit is it provides a source of investment funds. Insurance companies collect premiums up front and invest those premiums in a variety
      of investment vehicles, and pay claims if they occur.<br>
      
      (Apart from the safety and security benefits of buying insurance, there are also the income tax benefits that you can avail.)<br>
        - Life insurance premium of up to Rs 1.5 lakh can be claimed as a tax-saving deduction under Section 80C.<br>
        - Medical insurance premium of up to Rs 25,000 for yourself and your family and Rs 25,000 for your parents can be claimed as a tax-saving deduction under Section 80D.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Insurability (risk which can be insured)</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">Typically all private companies shares seven common characteristics:<br><br>
        <b>Large number of similar exposure units:</b> Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes,
          allowing insurers to benefit from the law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses.<br><br>
        <b>Defintie loss:</b> The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy.
          Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion<br><br>
        <b>Accidental loss:</b> The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure.<br><br>
        <b>Large loss:</b> The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy,
          adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.<br><br>
        <b>Affordable preimum:</b> If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered,
          then it is not likely that the insurance will be purchased, even if on offer.<br><br>
        <b>Calculable loss:</b> There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost.<br><br>
        <b>Limited risk of catastrophically losses:</b> Insurable losses are ideally independent and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer;
          insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base.
