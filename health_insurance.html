    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Health Insurance<br>(protect your family and your savings from severe illnesses)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Lets put it in a simple way, health insurance is an insurance product which covers medical and surgical expenses of an insured individual. It usually pays for 
            losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or sometimes dental expenses and accidental death. The way it typically works is that the consumer (you)           
            pays an up front premium to a health insurance company and in any case there is medical emergancy which leads to hospitalization of the insured, the 
            health insurance company pays your medical bills.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Health insurance is an agreement between a health insurance company and you, whereby insurance company agrees to undertake a guarantee of 
            compensation for medical expenses in case the insured falls ill or meets with an accident which leads to hospitalization of the insured. Health insurance 
            helps pay for your health care, it help cover services ranging from routine doctor visits to major medical costs from a serious illness or injury and sometimes 
            it also covers many preventive services to keep you healthy.
            <br><br>
            Buying a health insurance policy for yourself and your family is important because medical care is expensive and it's one the rise year after year, especially in 
            the private sector. Hospitalisation can burn your all savings and completely disturb your budget. It will become even tough, if the person who brings in the 
            money, is now in a hospital bed. Well you know what to do, you can avoid all this by just paying a small annual premium which would lessen your stress in 
            case of medical emergencies.
            <br><br>
            Basically, all insurance companies have tie-ups with the leading hospitals so they can provide cashless treatment to the insured. If the insurance company 
            has no tie-ups with the hospital, they reimburse the cost of expenses incurred by the insured. The government also promotes health insurance by providing 
            a deduction from income tax (discussed later in this article).
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">Types</h4>

            <b>Family Health Insurance Plan:</b> Under this policy, an individual can include all the family members against multiple diseases ubrnder a single cover. 
            These type of plans offers a fixed sum assured for the family members, which can be availed by all members of the family or by any one individual in the 
            family.<br><br>

            <b>Surgery and Critical Illness Insurance Plan:</b> This plan is good for those individuals, who requires treatment against critical illness, such as heart attack, 
            kidney failure, paralysis etc. As the medical expenses of these treatments are very high, the premium of these types of policies is also high.<br><br>

          </p>

          <h4 class="color">Consider these points before buying a health insurace policy</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Itâ€™s quite difficult to select the best insurance policy as all insurance company provide similar type of insurance plans. But still we've figured out somethings 
            that you will always help you choose the best policy:<br><br>
            - Minimum entry age<br>
            - It is always good to know, how much premium you're paying and what is your policy covering for you.<br>
            - Always choose a policy which have minimum waiting period.<br>
            - Choose a insurance company which have a big network of hospitals or you could say, have a tie-up with lot of hospitals, it helps with cashless. 
            hospitalization. Because sometimes it's hard to arrange funds at the time of a medical emergency.<br>
            - Buy a plan that covers expenses incurred before and after the hospitalization.<br>
            - Always look for the No-Claim-Bonus (NCB) clause in a insurance policy, and choose which offers you best NCB.<br>
            - Choose a policy which offers preventive health check-up facility.<br>
            - Before you sign anything look for the co-payment clause, try to buy a policy which do not have any co-payment clause in it. It is basically the percentage 
            amount that you would pay at the time of claim and rest will be paid by the insurer.<br>
            - In India, people under 45 years of age are not required to undergo a mandatory health checkup when buying a health insurance policy. However, it is 
            required to disclose any pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. Usually, it's good if you get a health insurance at young age so you don't 
            have to pay high premium.
