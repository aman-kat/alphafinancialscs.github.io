    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Hello there, Investors!!</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Investment can be described in many ways, first lets put it in a simpler manner: an act of putting money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit.            
            The term <b>investment</b> can refer to any mechanism used for generating future income.
            <br><br>
            Now lets describe it further in two ways, Economic and Finance.<br><b>An investment in an ecomomic,</b> is the purchase of goods that are not consumed 
            today but are used in the future to create wealth (in economic, investments means longer-term savings).<br><b>An investment in finance,</b> is a purchase 
            of assets (shares of a company), so that in future the assets will provide the income or you can sell them later at a higher price for a profit.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Investing is putting money to work to start or expand projects - or to purchase assets - where those funds are then put to work, with the goal to income and 
            increased value over time. Every investor invests with a specific objective in mind, and each investment has its own unique set of benefits and risks. Investors 
            think a lot about, how big a company's valuation can grow to over time, because they need to get there money back and make huge profits.
            <br><br>
            Investors can be repaid in several ways, they can be repaid on a “straight schedule” (if they are providing loans instead of buying equity), based upon their 
            percentage of ownership, or they can be paid back at a “preferred rate” of return. Safety is the main concern in investment, some investors do not take 
            much risk and some are more risk tolerant, thus more willing to lose some of their principal in return for the chance of generating a higher profit.
            <br><br>
            Investments can be stocks, bonds, mutual funds, interest-bearing accounts, land, derivatives, real estate, artwork, old comic books, jewelry etc.            
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">Investment Banks</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Investment banking is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities.

            performance. Professionals who work for investment banks may have careers as financial advisors, traders or salespeople. An investment banking career can 
            be very lucrative, but it typically comes with long hours and significant stress.

            potential. The returns to the venture capitalists depend upon the growth of the company.  Venture capitalists have the power to influence major decisions of
