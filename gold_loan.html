            your gold with the lender, you will get them back as soon as you pays back the loan amount inculuding interest. The financial institutes gives a loan amount 
            as per the market value of gold to the borrower. Gold loan being secure, features short processing times, a low interest rate and short to medium term

          <p class="bot_padding">
            Gold loans are secured loans where gold jewellery is used as collateral. You pledge your gold jewellery with the lender, after evaluations of pledged gold's 
            purity and weight, the lender sanctions the loan. After the repayment (principal amount + interest), you get back your gold jewellery, as simple as its 
            possible. Nationalised banks, private banks, and other financial institutions offer these loans at affordable interest rates.
            <br><br>
            The gold’s market value is determined based on its current rate. Also, the approval of this loan does not depend upon your credit history or income. The 
            process is quick and usually takes a day. So whether you need to fund a wedding, family vacation or your child’s education, it is a great way to meet your 
            sudden money requirement. Most lenders offer a gold loan with a value up to 75 percent of the pledged gold’s market value. Gold loan tenures are usually 
            short and range from to 3-12 months. However, some lenders may offer you a longer tenure and if gold prices increase drastically during the loan tenure, 
            banks may ask for the extra payment.
