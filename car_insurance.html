        <div>
            <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
            <p class="bot_padding">
              In today’s world, a car insurance is an important policy for every car owner. Car insurance is a contract between you and the insurer, car insurance is done to 
              protect your vehicle from unforeseen risks. It basically covers accidents, thefts. It covers against both natural and man-made calamities. In exchange for your 
              paying a premium (often payed annually), the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy.
            </p>

            <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
            <p class="bot_padding">
              Car insurance works on a "use it or lose it” policy. To avail it, you have to pay a yearly premium. If you are fortunate enough to not have a serious enough 
              accident to want to claim, you lose the premium amount you paid for protection. In case if you do not claim, you get a No Claim Bonus, which is a pretty 
              substantial amount, starting from 20% of the premium in the first year to 50% in the sixth year, so its really great if you do not claim for minor damages.
              <br><br>
              Moreover, the primium amount of your car insurance is decided based on the Insured Declared Value (IDV). If you increase the IDV, the premium rises and if 
              you lower it, the premium reduces and when you renew your policy after a year your IDV will decrease because of the rate of depreciation that is applied on 
              vehicles between one and two years.
              <br><br>
              Some policies also compensate for damages to your car during natural calamities like floods or earthquakes. It also covers third-party liability where you 
              have to pay damages to other vehicle owners. It is mandatory to buy car insurance in India irrespective of the vehicle type, i.e. personal or commercial 
              vehicle.
