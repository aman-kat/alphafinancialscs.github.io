    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Life Insurance<br>(read it carefully)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Life Insurance is a contract between the policy holder and the insurance company, where the life insurance company pays a specific sum to the insured 
            individual's family upon his death. Lets put it in a more simpler way: An individual buys a life insurance policy from a insurance company, pays a amount 
            known as the premium, if the policyholder dies while the policy is active, the insurer pays out a tax-free sum of money, known as the death benefit.
            The party that receive the death benefit are typically family members called beneficiaries.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            As we've already discussed, life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurer, where the insurer guarantees payment of the death benefit to 
            named beneficiaries upon the death of the insured, in exchange for a premium often paid regularly (depends on your policy type). The death benefit helps 
            the beneficiaries achieve financial goals, like college, homeownership and to pay-out the debts etc. 
            <br><br>
            If you die during the term, a death benefit is paid out. However, if you don't die during the term then, the premium money returned to you, without any 
            interest and completely tax-free, as it is not considered income but simply a refund of premiums. Other events than death such as terminal illness or critical 
            illness can also trigger payment, everything is written into your policy, so read it carefully before signing any.
            <br><br>
            Specific exclusions are often written into the contract; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion and some 
            diseases like fourth stage cancers, HIV, certain types of diabetes, some rare deadly diseases and many more are not coverd under your policy, so if an insured 
            dies due to these kind of disease, then you won't get any kind of claim. So you may wanna look out for these certain clauses.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">Types of Life Insurance</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            <b>Term insurance plan:</b> These kind of plans are purchased for a fixed period of time, say 10-20 years or maybe more. These policies are cheaper as 
            compared to other policies as there are no maturity benefit. This policy can only be claimed on the occurrence of the event.
            <br><br>
            <b>Endowment policy:</b> There's one difference between the term insurance plan and the endowment policy. Endowment policy comes with the extra 
            benefit that the policyholder will receive a lump sum amount in case if he survives until the date of maturity. Rest details are same as term insurance plan.
            <br><br>
            <b>Unit Linked Insurance Plan:</b> These plans gives you life security and offers to build wealth in addition. Premium paid is basically devided into two 
            parts, one for the Life insurance and another for the purpose of building wealth. This plan even offers to partially withdraw some amount.
            <br><br>
            <b>Money Back Policy:</b> This is same as the endowment policy, the difference is that this policy provides many survival benefits which are allotted over 
            the period of the policy term.
            <br><br>
            <b>Whole Life Policy:</b> As the name says, this policy does not ends at a specific period of time rather it extends up to the whole life of the insured. This 
            policy also provides the survival benefit to the insured. The policyholder can partially withdraw the sum insured.
            <br><br>
            <b>Annuity/ Pension Plan:</b> The amount collected as premium is accumulated as assets and distributed to the policyholder in form of income, annually 
            or lump sum depending on the instruction of insured.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="color">Consider these points before buying a Life insurance</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            <b>Carefully read all Terms and conditions:</b> After going through loads of insurance policies when you select one, read all the Terms and Conditions 
            carefully as it contain all relevant information of an insurance policy. Make sure that you read every word of T&C and understand completely before signing 
            an insurance policy.
            <br><br>
            <b>Look for Lock-in period:</b> Sometimes when you buy an insurance policy, without thinking through and later you realises that you are not completely 
            satisfied, in such conditions some insurance companies offer a lock-in period, which is a short time usually 15 days where you can return the policy to the 
            insurer or make another purchase.
            <br><br>
            <b>Payment options:</b> All insurance companies offer premium payment options as annual, semi-annual, quarterly or on monthly basis. It is good if you 
            option for Electronic Check System (ECS) payment means it will debit your bank account with the required insurance amount when its time to pay for your 
            premium.
            <br><br>
            <b>Donâ€™t try to hide any information:</b> Sometime individuals try to hide information when filling out the insurance application form. Misinformation can 
            cause some serious issues when you try to make claims.
          </p>
