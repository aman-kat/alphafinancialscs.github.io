        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            A home/housing loan, also known as a mortgage, is an amount of money borrowed by an individual (you), usually from banks and NBFCs to buy a house, 
            simple. A home loan is a secured loan as your property/home (basically just papers) is used by the lender as a colletral, if you default on the loan, the lender 
            holds the right to take possession of your home and sell it to pay off your debts.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            It works as other secured loans works, you pledge your property as a colletral to the financial institutions in exchange they debt the borrower money. Which 
            the borrower has to pay back with interest in EMI's over a period of time that can vary between 10-30 years depending on your lender and the loan 
            agreement. Financial institutions usually provide up to 80-85% of the market value of the house as loan amount. The bank or financial institution will hold 
            the title or deed to the property till the loan has been paid back wih interest.
            <br><br>
            Deed of Trust – this document lists the legal obligations and rights of you and the lender. It also states the lender's right to foreclose on the home if you 
            default on the loan. However, there are also certain tax benefits available on home loan under the Section 80EE of Income tax act. The Income tax deduction 
            can be claimed on home loan interest by first time home buyers only. The interest rate on these loans is either fixed, floating or hybrid based on your 
            agreement.
