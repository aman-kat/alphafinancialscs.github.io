    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Loan Against Property<br>(these doesn't have restrictions like home loans)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            As the name suggests loan against property (LAP), is the loan that you avail by keeping your commercial/residential property as collateral with the bank or a 
            financial institution. The value of your property decides the amount of loan you will be sanctioned, generally banks lend up to 50% to 60% of the value of 
            the property and you would've understood as property is kept as collateral with the bank, so obviously it is a secured loan.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            LAP works in a similar fashion as home loans, you pledge your property to avail a loan from a bank/NBFC and you repay the laon amount within given time with 
            interest.Though, home loans come with restrictions like you can not use them other than buying a home, on the other hand LAP come with no end usage restriction, 
            borrowers can utilise the funds as their will, you can use them to start a new business or expand an existing one, marriages, child's education, medical 
            expenses, debt consolidation and what not. 
            <br><br>
            The lender takes into consideration many factors such as your income, age, spouseâ€™s income, value of property to decide on your loan amount, usually banks 
            lends upto 60% of the value of property, private sector banks may offer upto 75% of the property's value as a loan. In case you fail to repay the loan, the 
            lender has all right to auction your property and recover the money. LAPs are reasonably convenient to avail and repay due to the relatively low interest rate.
          </p>
