          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Home insurance, also commonly called homeowner's insurance is a form of property insurance that covers losses and damages to an individual's residence, 
            along with furnishings and other assets in the home. Most home insurance policies cover the main dwelling, garage and other outbuildings that can be 
            locked up. Some lenders usually requires you to have it if you have a home loan.
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Whether we own or rent, our homes and our possessions are precious. Choosing to insure them, and making sure you have the right insurance products for 
            your circumstances and lowers the financial pain of repairing your home and replacing damaged or stolen belongings. You can insure your property, its 
            contents, or both. Home insurance also provides liability coverage against accidents in the home or on the property.
            <br><br>
            A homeowners insurance policy usually covers four kinds of incidents on the insured property, which includes interior damage, exterior damage, loss or 
            damage of personal assets/belongings, and injury that occurs while on the property. When a claim is made on any of these incidents, the homeowner will be 
            required to pay a deductible, which in effect is the out-of-pocket costs for the insured. Typical home insurance policies offer coverage for damage caused by 
            fires, lightning strikes, windstorms and hail. For example, damage caused by earthquakes and floods are not typically covered by homeowners insurance.
            You may also be able to purchase additional coverages for greater protection. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">Who needs home insurance?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            Home insurance is required by your mortgage lender, while it's not a state requirement like auto insurance, you typically need home insurance if you're 
            financing your house. Home insurance guards your lender's investment from loss or damage caused by covered risks like a fire or vandalism.
