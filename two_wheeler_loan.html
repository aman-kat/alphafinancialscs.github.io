          <p class="bot_padding">
            A two-wheeler loan helps you purchase a motorcycle or a scooter of your choice and pay for it in EMIs. Both banks as well as NBFCs offer these loans.
            Two-wheeler loans are available for both salaried and self-employed individuals. However, to qualify for a loan from these lenders, you need to fulfil certain 
            eligibility criteria.

          <p class="bot_padding">
            Two wheeler loans are considered to be the simplest and the fastest way to buy your dream bike. A two wheeler loan also known as a bike loan requires you 
            to pay a minimum down payment up front, this increases your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Mostly banks and NBFCs offer financing up to 90% of the vehicle 
            amount, so you only have to pay the 10% as down payment.
            <br><br>
            It works as all other loans, banks/financial institution offers you loan to buy your dream bike and you pay the loan amount (principal amount) in given 
            peroid with interest. There is no such fixed credit score required for a bike loan, but it is advisable to have a score between 600 and 750, as this range is 
            considered ideal for banks and credit institutions. Once your loan application has been approved you can ride out with a two-wheeler of your choice.
