    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Education Loan<br>(before pursuing higher studies, read this first)</h2>
        <div>
          <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">            
            A education loan is a type of loan which help students pay for college educations and other school-related expenses, 
            such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses. 
            Payments are often made after a six-month grace period, after graduation. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
          <p class="bot_padding">
            An education loan offers a moratorium period that reduces the immediate burden of the repayment start after the completion 
            of the course. Generally, the repayment starts when the course is completed. So a student can start paying the loan EMIs a 
            year after the completion of the course or 6 months after getting a job, whichever is earlier. 
            During the course period, the bank charges simple interest rate on the loan.
            <br><br>
            Education loans are issued for the purpose of attending an academic institution and pursuing an academic degree. 
            Education loans can be obtained from the government or through private-sector lending sources. It covers the 
            basic course fee and other related expenses such as (college) accommodation, exam and other miscellaneous charges.
            <br><br>
            If you don't make your payment, your loan goes into delinquency status. If you still don't pay, your school, the 
            financial institution that made or owns your loan, your loan guarantor, and the federal government can all take action 
            to recover the money you owe for your student loan debt.
            <br><br>
            If you decided to make payments earlier, there aren't any pre-payment penalties on education loans. You can make extra 
            payments on your student loans or pay them off in-full without paying any fees or other penalties.
          </p>

          <p class="bot_padding">

            education loans. So when you get you education, and get a job at some big company, you can pay the loan amount back and no harms done.
            In short, education loans are good idea because the price for higher educations are really high.
