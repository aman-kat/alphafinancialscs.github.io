    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Loans<br>(things you need to know)</h2>
      <div>
      <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
      <p class="bot_padding">        
        A sum of money that is borrowed and expected to be paid back with interest and finance charges, simple. Basically a loan is a type of debt. Whoever 
        borrows, needs to repay the lender the sum of money loaned part-by-part (EMIs) over time in order to clear the debt. Loans are typically issued by 
        corporations, financial institutions, and governments or you could receive money from a friend. They can be unsecured, like a personal loan or cash advance 
        loan, or they may be secured, like a mortgage or home equity line.
      </p>
      
      <h4 class="color">How it works?</h4>
      <p class="bot_padding">       
        When you apply for a loan, lenders typically look at these five eligibility criteria when analyzing an application for a (personal) <sup>1</sup>loan<br>
          - Credit Score<br>
          - Current Income and Expenses<br>
          - Employment History<br>
          - Equated Monthly Installment<br>
          - Repayment History
          <br><br>          
          When you take out a loan, your payments are primarily broken up into two parts - principal and interest. The loan principal is the amount you borrow and 
          goes down as you begin to pay it back, while interest is the cost of borrowing the money. That means you borrow a fixed amount of money and pay it back 
          with interest in monthly installments (EMIs) over the life of the loan (time period is decided by your lender).
          <br><br>
          When you borrow money from any financial institution, you recieve a loan agreement too. Borrowing money is a big commitment no matter the amount, 
          which is why it is important to protect both parties with a loan agreement in place. The purpose of a loan agreement is to detail what is being loaned, 
          interests, fees and when the borrower has to pay it back as well as how. The terms of a loan are agreed to by each party in the transaction before any money or property changes hands or is disbursed. If the lender requires collateral, this requirement will be outlined in the loan documents.
          <br>
          Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions.
      </p>
      
    <h4 class="color">Types</h4>
    <h6><b><sup>2</sup>Secured loans & Unsecured loans</b></h6>
    <p> Mortgages and car loans are secured loans, as they are both backed & secured by collateral.
        Loans such as credit cards and signature loans are unsecured means they are not backed by any collateral. 
        Unsecured loans typically have higher interest rates than secured loans, as they are riskier for the lender. 
        With a secured loan, the lender can repossess the collateral in the case of default. 
        However, interest rates vary wildly on unsecured loans depending on multiple factors, including the borrower's credit history.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h6><b>Loans can also be described as <sup>3</sup>Revolving or Term.</b></h6>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      Revolving refers to a loan that can be spent, repaid and spent again, while term loans refer to a loan paid off in equal monthly installments over a set period.
      for example a credit card is an unsecured revolving loan, while a Line of Credit (LOC) is a secured revolving loan and a car loan is a secured term loan, and a signature loan is an unsecured term loan.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Interest Rates</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding"> Interest rates have a significant effect on loans. 
        Loans with high interest rates have higher monthly payments — or take longer to pay off.
      <br><br>
      <b>Simple interest</b> is interest on the principal loan, which banks almost never charge borrowers.<br>
        For example, if an individual takes out a Rs. 300,000 loan from the bank, and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 14% annually. 
        So, the borrower will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of Rs. 300,000 and 14% extra as interest on the original amount. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Compound interest</b> is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. 
      Compound interest is interest earned on money that way previously earned as interest, this cycle leads to increasing interest. 
      In short words, it is not good for you if you're paying a loan back.
      <br><b>Let's evaluate it a little bit further or you can leave it here, that'll be fine, because its a little bit confusing.</b><br>
        Compound interest is interest on interest and means more money in interest has to be paid by the borrower. 
        The interest is not only applied to the principal but also the accumulated interest of previous periods. 
        The bank assumes that at the end of the first year, the borrower owes it the principal plus interest for that year. 
        At the end of the second year, the borrower owes it the principal and the interest for the second year plus the interest 
        on interest for the first year.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Benefits of Loans</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">
        <b>Financial Flexibilty:</b> Loans allows you to meet a financial requirement or expenses that occurs in your life. 
        Taking a loan provides you a certain financial freedom as it equips you to take care of big one time expenses without disturbing your planned budget.
        <br><br>
        <b>Easy availability:</b> All types of loans are approved as quickly as possible, mostly 48 hours - based on the details of income and financial history of the borrower 
        and in some cases the collateral to be attached.
        <br><br>
        <b>You can get required amount:</b> Based on your income and financial history, the amount you require as loan can be disbursed to you.
        <br><br>
        <b>Convenient tenure:</b> The tenure of a loan is ample depending on the bank and amount. 
        Loans are generally available for a tenure of 12 months to 60 months or more for secured loans.
        <br><br>
        <b>Tax Benefits:</b> According to the Income Tax Act of 1961, almost all types of loans offer tax benefits which you can avail.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Why you should consider taking a loan?</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">
        <b>To complete your life goals:</b> Everyone have a lot of dreams in there life no doubt. So when you want financial assistance to make your life 
        a reality be it a house, car or higher education.
        <br>
        <b>If you've any immediate financial requirements:</b> You can apply for a loan when you have a financial emergency.<br><br>
        In general, personal loans can be a good idea for consumers with excellent credit. But if you don't have excellent credit, 
        a personal loan might come with an interest rate so high that it's more than some credit card rates. 
        Make sure you know the interest rate before you take on a personal loan.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Consider these points before applying for a loan</h4>
    <p class="bot_padding">
        <b>Credit score:</b> Before you apply for a loan you need to check your credit history. 
        A credit history is a record of your previous borrowings (if any) and repayment record. 
        This will explain if you have been responsible for re-paying or have lapsed payments in the past. 
        A credit score of 750 and above will be really good.
        <br><br>
        <b>Interest Rates:</b> Check the loan interest rate before you actually apply for one. 
        Loans which require a collateral or secured loans generally have lower interest rates than loans which don’t require any collateral or should I say unsecured loans.
        <br><br>
        <b>Processing fee and other charges:</b> When you apply for a loan and if you miss your payment deadlines for your loan, 
        you will be likely to pay a processing and penalty fee respectively. These fees and charges depend on the loan amount and bank. So make sure you read your loan agreement properly.
        <br><br>
        <b>Income:</b> Lenders main concern is your repayment capacity. So, meeting the bank’s income requirement is the most important criteria for a loan applicant. 
        Higher income, easier the process to apply for larger loans with longer tenure.
        <br><br>
        <b>Age:</b> A person with more working-age on his side is more likely to get a long-term loan approved as compared to 
        an older person closer to retirement or a fresher.
    </p>

    <h4 class="color">Let's pay attention to some terms carefully</h4>
    <br>
    <h6 class="color">Line of Credit</h6>
    <p class="bot_padding">A line of credit (LOC ) is a pre-set borrowing limit that can be used at any time. 
      The borrower can take money out as needed until the limit is reached, and as money is repaid, it can be borrowed again in the case of an open line of credit.
      A Line of Credit is an arrangement between a financial institution (usually a bank) — and a client that establishes the maximum loan amount the customer can borrow. 
      The borrower can access funds from the line of credit at any time as long as they do not exceed the maximum amount 
      (or credit limit) set in the agreement or meet any other requirements such as making timely minimum payments.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h6 class="color">Credit Card</h6>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      A credit card is a card issued by a bank, and with this the cardholder can borrow funds from that bank (which issues the card). 
      Cardholders agree to pay the money back with interest (according to the banks's terms). Interest charges on the unpaid balance charged 
      to the card are typically imposed one month after a purchase is made. Most major credit cards, which include Visa, MasterCard, and 
      American Express, are issued by banks or other financial institutions. Many credit cards attract customers by offering incentives such as 
      hotel room rentals, gift certificates to major retailers and cash back on purchases. 
      <br><br>
      Credit cards feature higher annual percentage rates (APRs) than other forms of consumer loans. Credit card use is also reflected on a 
      consumer’s credit report, which allows responsible spenders to raise their credit scores with a history of timely payments.
      
      <br><br>
      <b>Some types of Credit Cards</b><br>
      - Standard cards: simply extend a line of credit to their users<br>
      - Rewards cards: offer cash back, travel points, or other benefits to customers<br>
      - Secured credit: cards require an initial cash deposit that is held by the issuer as collateral<br>
      - Charge cards: have no preset spending limit, but often do not allow unpaid balances to carry over from month to month
      
      <br><br>
      <b>Points to consider before applying or start using any credit card</b><br>
      - Credit cards are almost always unsecured<br>
      - Credit cards will offer you rewards programs and they’ll also often come with annual fees<br>
      - Usually credit cards comes with higher interest rates and lower credit limits<br>
      - Credit cards charge high APRs and fees for cash advances
    </p>

    <h6 class="color">Unsecured Loans</h6>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      Unsecured loans sometimes referred to as signature loans or personal loans. An unsecured loan is a loan that is issued only by the borrower’s 
      creditworthiness and it isn't supported by any type of collateral. Typically, borrowers must have high credit scores to be approved for certain unsecured 
      loans. A credit score is a numerical representation of a borrower’s ability to pay back debt and reflects a consumer’s creditworthiness based on their credit 
      history.
      <br><br>
      Unsecured loans, because they are not backed by pledged assets, are riskier for lenders, and typically come with higher interest rates. Unsecured loans 
      include credit cards, student loans, and personal loans, all of which can be revolving or term loans.
      <br>
        - A revolving loan has a credit limit, that can be spent, repaid, and spent again. Examples of revolving unsecured loans include credit cards and 
          personal lines of credit.<br>
        - A term loan, is a loan that the borrower repays in equal installments until the end of its term. While these types of loans are often affiliated with 
          secured loans, there are also unsecured term loans.<br>
        - A consolidation loan to pay off credit cards or a signature loan from a bank would be considered as an unsecured term loan.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h6 class="color">Secured Loans</h6>
    <p class="bot_padding">
      Secured loan is loan backed by collateral to reduce the risk associated with lending the money, such as a mortgage. 
      If the borrower defaults on repayment, the bank seizes the assets, sells it. Assets backing loan are considered security, 
      which is why unsecured loan is considered a riskier investment than secured loan. 
      Secured debt is a formal contract backed by assets that can be sold as collateral if the person/business defaults on the loan.
      Due to its low-risk profile, secured debt is favored among those with poor credit.
      <br><br>
      For example, if you use a home loan to buy a home (obviously), as everybody knows home loans are secured loans. 
      The registry documents of your home are kept as a collateral until you pay the loan back, and in any case you're not able to pay the loan back, 
      the bank will seize your property/home and of course as mentioned above will sell it.
      <br><br>
      <b>Here are some secured loan types</b><br>
      1) Home Loan<br>
      2) Loan Against Property<br>
      3) Gold Loans<br>
      4) Loans Against Shares, Fixed Deposits & Mutual Funds
