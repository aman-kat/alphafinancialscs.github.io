    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Car Loan<br>(let's buy your dream Car)</h2>
        <div>
        <h4 class="color">Description</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
          A car loan (also known as an automobile loan, or auto loan) is a sum of money a consumer borrows in order to purchase a car. A car loan is secured against 
          the vehicle you intend to purchase, which means the vehicle serves as collateral for the loan, in any case you can't pay the loan back the lender can seize the car.
          <br><br>
          More specifically, a lender loans the borrower (you) money to purchase a vehicle. In return, the borrower agrees to pay back the lender the amount of the 
          loan plus interest, usually in monthly payments, until the amount owed is fully paid off. Much like a mortgage, the lender retains ownership over the asset 
          until you make the final payment.
        </p>

        <h4 class="color">How it Works?</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
          You cannot imagine living without a car because that would restrict you form going places for work, duties or leisure, hindering a good social and 
          professional life. But with newer technologies and lesser resources, the cost of cars are on a rise, often making it extremely difficult for the average individual 
          to purchase their vehicle outright only using ones savings.
          <br><br>
          An auto loan works much the same way as other types of loans. You take out a car loan through a financial institution, like a bank or the auto dealer where 
          you’re getting the car. That institution agrees to loan you money to buy the car, and you agree to pay back the amount you borrowed through monthly 
          payments, plus interest. If you don’t keep up with your payments, the lender may take possession of your car. Upon entering into the loan agreement the 
          borrower gains the right to drive the car, while also taking possession of the car’s title (a document showing proof of ownership of a piece of property). 
          Technically speaking, however, the borrower does not yet own the car; the lender owns the car until the borrower has finished paying off the loan.
        </p>

        <h4 class="color">Interest Rates</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
          As the lender has financial control over the car, it's a secured loan - the debt is deemed a lower risk, which generally translates to a significantly 
          reduced interest rate for the borrower. Interest rates are also fixed, so borrowers are not subjected to the increases that can be associated with unsecured 
          personal loans.
        </p>

        <h4 class="color"><sup>1</sup>Eligibility Criteria</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
          1) The borrower should be salaried, self-employed, business owner or a professional<br>

        <h4 class="color">Benefits and Features</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
          In India, apart from the issue that paying such a huge sum of cash may disturb one's budget, massive purchases with liquid cash could put you on the 
          Income Tax department's radar as well. One of the greatest car loan benefits in India that the loan is secured against the car itself. You also get to use your 
          car while you are servicing the car loan term. Car loans, therefore, are a very safe and certain way of purchasing your own car.
          <br><br>
          - One can option for new or used car loan depending upon the need and the kind of car requirement.<br>
          - Car loans in India generally provide a fixed rate of interest option while repayment through EMIs. This keeps you assured of a fixed repayable amount on a 
          monthly basis towards the car loan, facilitating better budget planning without disturbing your usual expenses.<br>

          - Car loan borrowers can avail loans up to Rs. 1.5 cores, mostly comprising of 100% of the vehicle's on-road price. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="color">So, what's the upshot?</h4>
        <p class="bot_padding">
